# Apple-Disease-Detection-and-Classifications
This work is computed by integrating CNN and BiLSTM in an end-to-end learning system for Apple leaf disease detection and classification. The result shows more than 99% of performances in each metrics. 
The data here are shared as sample datasets. As there is restriction to deploy data size, I only put here sample images only. 
Enjoy!
